                    Based on the discussions,

                    In this learning adventure, you are given the task to train
                    to become a change agent. You will go on an adventure to
                    discover four of the climate change tipping points of Earth.
                    Your main training task is to rewrite the Book of Serendip.
                    This is the Book of Earth which consists of everything that
                    happened, happens and will happen to this planet. Right now,
                    the future of Earth shown in the Book of Serendip is not
                    sustainable for humanity. Therefore, more action needs to be
                    taken. In each episode, you will have a specific task to do,
                    which will materialize in a Book chapter. Every time a new
                    chapter is added, the future of the planet will become more
                    sustainable.
